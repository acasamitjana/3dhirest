# 3D Histology Reconstruction

This repository hosts the code for 3D histology reconstruction using a probabilistic model of spatial deformation that yields 
reconstructions for multiple histological stains that are jointly smooth, robust to outliers and follow the reference shape.

The framework is used for accurate 3D reconstruction of two stains (Nissl and parvalbumin) from the Allen human brain atlas (/scripts).
